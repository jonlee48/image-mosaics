# Project 3: Image Mosaics

## Team Members
- Jonathan Lee
- Graham Schock
- Jack Umina

## Overview
Image mosaics are created by compositing multiple images together by computing the perspective transformation between images. We captured our own photographs and implemented a GUI so that users could select features to map between images. We also implemented three bells and whistles.
